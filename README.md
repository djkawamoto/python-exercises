# tech-academy-drills
This repository is a collection of drills completed while at The Tech Academy - a software developer school in Portland, OR. For all of these drills, a scenario was provided but how to write the code was left up to me.

FileTransferUIProject
  An exercise to write script for the following scenario:
  A company needs to have the ability to select a folder to check for recently modified files and select a folder to copy those files to. The UI also needs to include a button to initiate the file transfer (functionality is added after FileCheckerCopier is completed).

  FileCheckerCopier
    An exercise to write script which does the following:
  1. Check for files in a directory that have been changed in the last 24hrs.
  2. Copy those files to a new folder.

PyShutilDrill
  An exercise exploring the use of the shutil module to moves files to a new location.

DateTimeDrill1.py
  This was an exercise using the datetime module. The scenario is an company headquartered in Portland with offices in New York and London needed to have Python script written to provide the time in Portland plus each office and whether or not that office was open at the time the script is run.

WeepleAttack
  For this exercise we were given free reign to create a simple game. I didn't like the simplicity of the example so I created my own. In case you're unfamiliar, weeples are little furry cotton-ball like creatures with googley eyes, antennas and paper feet. A quick image search should find them. Anyway, I wanted something fun and kind of silly with more interesting mechanics than simple addition and subtraction. If time allows, I wouldn't mind changing some of the math involved to make this game more interesting and exploring the idea of turning it into a mobile app for pre-teen kids or adults like me who occasionally like to have some mindless fun.
